# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I started using github to include a bunch of coding projects I did while in my Digital Health and Data Analytics course conducted by the Michener Institute.  I am interested in harnessing these new programming skills so that I can pivot in my career - I have spent the last 12 years in Sonography but now would like to try something different!  I learned basic coding using Python, R, and SAS and I absolutely loved every minute of it.  I plan to continue and develop my programming skills with fun, useful projects.
It has been 4 months since I have been on here - life has been crazy, but I am back and hoping to master the pull requests now!
